# Postprocessing parameters for timestamp outputs from speaker diarization models.
# This speaker diarization postprocessing scheme is inspired by the postprocessing procedure in the following paper:
# Medennikov, Ivan, et al. "Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection: a Novel Approach for Multi-Speaker Diarization in a Dinner Party Scenario." (2020).
# These parameters were optimized with hybrid-loss trained Sortformer model introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06656.
